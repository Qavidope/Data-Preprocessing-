Data-Preprocessing-


 Techniques used in data preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: This step involves handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and removing or correcting any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

Data Integration: In some cases, data may be spread across multiple sources or files. Data integration involves combining the data from different sources into a single dataset.

Data Transformation: Data transformation involves converting the data into a suitable format for analysis. This may include scaling numeric variables, encoding categorical variables, and transforming skewed distributions using techniques like logarithmic or power transformations.

Feature Selection: In large datasets, there may be numerous features, not all of which are relevant for analysis or modeling. Feature selection techniques help identify the most informative and important features that contribute to the task at hand.

Feature Engineering: This step involves creating new features from the existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model. It may include operations such as creating interaction terms, deriving new variables from existing ones, or applying mathematical functions.

Data Discretization: Sometimes, continuous variables may need to be transformed into discrete or categorical variables. This can be done using techniques such as binning or bucketing.

Data Normalization/Standardization: Normalizing or standardizing the data ensures that different variables are on the same scale, preventing certain variables from dominating others during analysis or modeling.

Handling Imbalanced Data: In classification problems, if the distribution of target classes is highly imbalanced, it can lead to biased models. Techniques like undersampling, oversampling, or generating synthetic samples can be applied to address this issue.

Splitting the Data: Finally, the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.
